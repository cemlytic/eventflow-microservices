# eventflow-microservices üöÄ

EventFlow is a platform that combines event management and real-time notifications using a microservices architecture. The project consists of two main loosely coupled services that communicate using an event-driven approach.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Asynchronous inter-service communication via the Redis Pub/Sub model.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Manages user access based on permission levels (e.g., Admin, Event Creator).
- **Real-Time Email Notifications:** Users receive instant email notifications when events they're subscribed to are updated.
- **Multi-Database System:** Each service uses a database suited for its specific purpose (MongoDB and MySQL).
- **Monorepo Structure:** All services and shared components are managed in a single repository, which enhances code consistency.
- **Docker Support:** The entire project environment can be easily set up and run using Docker.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project has a monorepo structure containing all services and shared packages.

- **`services/`**: Contains the main services of the application.
- **`packages/shared/`**: Houses common modules (e.g., error handling, rate limiting, roles) shared by multiple services, preventing code duplication.

## üöÄ Setup and Running
